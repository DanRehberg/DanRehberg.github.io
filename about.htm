			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<pre>My name is Dan Rehberg and this website demonstrates some of my personal, professional, and academic work in computer science. Without delving too deep in my projects on this page, I would like to share some of my philosophies as they might best describe my character. I have an adaptive state of mind, letting my ideas change or develop over time, but at present I firmly believe that most technological developments are part of the Universal Set of Logic. I use this perspective to consider how I can better translate various fields of study into something digestible for myself, and moreover my interchange format to do so has been in computational models.

My fascination with programming is that, as a computational model, I can share ideas about the world around me within a set of rules that are more decisive than natural language, and I can test out ideas on my own to falsify any curiosities I am currently pursuing. This, of course, is because the Von Neumann architecture of computers adapts the Turing model of computation - which provides an enormous amount of power in devising programs. Of interest to me is simulation, and asking if any of our current phenomenal models can be better represented using an instruction set that fits the abstract nature of a Turing machine. Aside from this big picture question, I have enjoyed pursuing the representation of reality in software as an exercise to better understand the world around me. I have a deep appreciation for linear and abstract algebra as well as differential systems as a result, and in the realm of physics have grown strongly attached to Lagrangian mechanics over Newtonian derivations of motion. With these tools, I like to explore how to reproduce aspects of the world: through reproduction of existing practices in software, but also by hypothesizing my own methods (from a computational first principles approach) to then compare against the existing models.

I think that just as some learn to love mathematics through the application in physics - getting to a place where one is naturally speaking the language - I have found computational logic to be my avenue to explore thoughts. These ideas can stem from purely theoretical or be based on the constraints imposed by current hardware and its instruction set architecture. There is nothing more fun than to get lost in my mind’s playground on a hike, compiling thoughts on procedurally producing wind noises through flora as a finite Taylor series pulled from an integral, or considering how to optimally reproduce the complex natural scene with cascading level-of-detail, and to piece together and question whether a formalism in a computer model can simulate all things from a finite infinitesimal level if it works in X, Y, or Z ways. Just like in mathematics, understanding the tools and not seeing an upper bound on how they can be applied is a wonderfully artistic avenue to deeply explore existence and nature.

Onto my current goals, I have just finished my undergraduate studies in computer science - returning to school as a potential path towards research. However, my interests are not limited only to academia as remarkable research and development comes out of private industry as well. My main interests are getting to continue to ask intriguing questions where I get to tinker as a software engineer to fully demonstrate and realize these ideas. Of importance, I believe in sharing knowledge, and wherever I end up long term, I am deeply invested in being able to publish information that could be beneficial to mankind. I see this as a social contract that I will obliging participate in; knowing that I have consumed an immense amount of information for free (or next to it) to become a more competent engineer. Having helped others learn new skills, I can see that I am not alone in feeling good about garnering new abilities; it seems like learning something of desire might be an intrinsic route to happiness.

In closing - and until I come back and modify this about page - while my interests are in simulation, the ideas I have pursued and actively participate in are highly interdisciplinary. My interests in this subject matter encapsulate both asking “what is fundamental,” “how can we build X in software,” and perpetually “can we do better?” As a result, I have studied - independently, on the job, and in academia - several subjects and am currently researching novel questions in a HCI lab for 3D user interfaces in AR/VR (or generally mixed reality) where I get to apply a variety of skills - going from software engineering to build real-time experiments for human participants, working with multiple schools and STEM disciplines towards common research goals, or writing benchmarking and profile tools on specialized SoC devices. My ultimate goal is to primarily focus on simulation, but expect side projects in adjacent areas that I have studied – computer graphics, parallelism, HPC, HCI, numerical methods, mechanics, distributed systems, networking, machine learning, to name a few – and areas I haven’t gotten full exposure to just yet – quantum computing, systems engineering, etc - to further develop my toolbox so I can continue to ask better questions for software based simulation, and - in general - to open more ways to test new questions I ask as my curiosity wanders.
