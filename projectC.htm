		<p>Contact constraints are a funny situation to deal with. Some aspects of simulations in computer science history relied on "discrete" solutions in which an intersection is solved only if an object is <strong>already penetrating another surface</strong>. This can cause issues if energy is supplemented in the system to force a separation of the two objects over time. "Continous" solutions counter this by attempting to examine the ongoing <strong>coherency of collisions over time</strong> while also attempting to gather intersection information <strong>leading up to an intersection</strong>. My solutions are somewhere in between, and feature <em>position projection</em> or <em>time of solving</em> depending on the situation. Yet, these solutions all attempt to <strong>force energy propagation in an ideal serial path</strong>.</p>

This is not comprehensive and instead lets me gently reconsider my old work: what works about it and what philosophical considerations I might change.</p>

					<p class="description">Careful arrangements to collision systems can allow position based corrections to remove intersections without needing to rely on a bias with impulse based dynamics. Temporal coherency is still worth heeding in these situations, but finding a stable contact set for a manifold to pass through a position constraint solver can enable stability without keeping strict records of previous contact positions.</p>
