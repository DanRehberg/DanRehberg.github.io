			<h3>February 1, 2022: <u>Article Added: Bounded by Morton Codes: Enhancing the Total Representable Space</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Scene Graphs/<a href="EnhancedSceneGraph.htm">Bounded by Morton Codes</a>. This article describes numerical representation of spatial bounds when following a Z-order curve approach to describing space in a binary data structure. Furthermore, it describes a method to increase the total amount of space available within a virtual environment using this accelerated data structure.</p>

			<h3>December 31, 2020: <u>Article Added: Reflecting on First Physics Engine</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/One Pass Mechanics/<a href="pdPhysics.htm">First Physics Engine</a>. This article is an informal reflection on the first physics engine I built back in 2014. With the new year about to commence, I thought it would be nice to reflect on my this engine as I am currently building a new physics system.</p>

			<h3>November 19, 2020: <u>Article Added: Synchronized Threads: Polling versus Interrupt</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Specialized Optimizations/<a href="threadPollInterrupt.htm">Synchronized Threads: Polling versus Interrupt</a>. This article discusses how spinlock and sleeping outperform each other in different circumstances. This should reinforce not doing pre-optimizations, and to implement an appropriate solution for keeping a thread pool in stasis, when not in use, only after use cases are known.</p>

			<h3>October 4, 2020: <u>Article Added: Constructing Sterescopic Images with Parallax Shading</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Graphics Programming/<a href="parallaxStereoEffect.htm">Constructing Stereoscopic Images with Parallax Shading</a>. I have started to look into older articles on image-based rendering as it is relevant to virtual reality (VR). However, I had decided to try to make stereoscopic images in 2016 for potential use in VR. This article presents the results.</p>

			<h3>September 5, 2020: <u>Article Added: Moving to Parallelism with Embarrassingly Parallel Problems</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Parallelism/<a href="chainingObjects.htm">Moving a Serial Problem to Parallel: Embarrassingly Parallel Problems</a>. Recently I have been preparing to build a new physics engine. Along the way I was building new serial and parallel methods to chain/island sets of interacting objects in my API for simulations. Describing this task offers a useful time to discuss an easy way to transition to parallel thinking.</p>

			<h3>August 10, 2020: <u>Article Added: Non-Iterative Position Projection</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/One Pass Mechanics/<a href="toiSpeculative.htm">Using Time of Solving and Speculative Contacts with Position Projection</a>. I have worked for a few years on avoiding contact resolution with an iterative constraint solver, but this more recent iteration involves replacing some processing overhead with speculative contacts.</p>

			<h3>July 13, 2020: <u>Article Added: Performant Java Code</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Specialized Optimizations/<a href="javaPBD.htm">Asynchronous Behavior in Java</a>. It discusses when OOP abstractions might not offer a programmer an ideal tool to implement in a specific project.</p>

			<h3>June 12, 2020: <u>Parallel Projects Area Added</u></h3>
			<p>An area for projects relating to parallelism and concurrency has been added. The first entry is a series of tests that illustrate performance differences in software when applied to a CPU and a GPU.</p>

			<h3>May 25, 2020: <u>Analysis of Code Branching on CPU vs. GPU</u></h3>
			<p>This Friday, information pertaining to an analysis of tests run between parallel workloads on a GPU and a CPU will be provided in the Projects area. This will be in a new category for "Parallel Workflow" and will have further projects included to describe problems faced with race conditions and mutual exclusion among other topics.</p>

			<h3>May 24, 2020: <u>Fixing Some Things</u></h3>
			<p>The site has been rearranged to offer categories within the projects area. This is to expand work that has been performed in a common subject - or what is at least related.</p>
