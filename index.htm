			<h3>September 5, 2020: <u>Article Added: Moving to Parallelism with Embarrassingly Parallel Problems</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Parallelism/<a href="chainingObjects.htm">Moving a Serial Problem to Parallel: Embarrassingly Parallel Problems</a>. Recently I have been preparing to build a new physics engine. Along the way I was building new serial and parallel methods to chain/island sets of interacting objects in my API for simulations. Describing this task offers a useful time to discuss an easy way to transition to parallel thinking.</p>

			<h3>August 10, 2020: <u>Article Added: Non-Iterative Position Projection</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/One Pass Mechanics/<a href="toiSpeculative.htm">Using Time of Solving and Speculative Contacts with Position Projection</a>. I have worked for a few years on avoiding contact resolution with an iterative constraint solver, but this more recent iteration involves replacing some processing overhead with speculative contacts.</p>

			<h3>July 13, 2020: <u>Article Added: Performant Java Code</u></h3>
			<p>An article has been added in Projects/Specialized Optimizations/<a href="javaPBD.htm">Asynchronous Behavior in Java</a>. It discusses when OOP abstractions might not offer a programmer an ideal tool to implement in a specific project.</p>

			<h3>June 12, 2020: <u>Parallel Projects Area Added</u></h3>
			<p>An area for projects relating to parallelism and concurrency has been added. The first entry is a series of tests that illustrate performance differences in software when applied to a CPU and a GPU.</p>

			<h3>May 25, 2020: <u>Analysis of Code Branching on CPU vs. GPU</u></h3>
			<p>This Friday, information pertaining to an analysis of tests run between parallel workloads on a GPU and a CPU will be provided in the Projects area. This will be in a new category for "Parallel Workflow" and will have further projects included to describe problems faced with race conditions and mutual exclusion among other topics.</p>

			<h3>May 24, 2020: <u>Fixing Some Things</u></h3>
			<p>The site has been rearranged to offer categories within the projects area. This is to expand work that has been performed in a common subject - or what is at least related.</p>
